SalesTax
========

An exercise. 

See ```docs\exercise-sales-tax.txt``` for the requirements.


Build
-----
Crack open a terminal and run ```build.cmd```.

The build script will download all the dependencies with NuGet, so an Internet connection is required.

The script will then build the solution and run the NUnit test suite.
